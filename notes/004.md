# 004
### What We Did 
-  In this case we wont need to create a handler for the bitmap and a exra Handler for device context to pass to it. We will need to allocate the  memory instead of let windows do it for us, for it we need to know amount of memory.
  We will use 4 bytes, 3 per RGB, and one for padding, because then, it will be align with the multiple of 4 bytes with 32 bits wordsize, which can cause performance issues in X86 architectures. Then we will get of those pixels per pixel on screen (WINDOWHEIGHT * WINDOWSWIDTH) * 4
  We will use VirtualAlloc() to get the memory allocated, which uses pages for memory allocation, the OS will take care of the loading and track of the pages. There is 2 modes, commit and reserve, the second one is used so the OS know but does not load or track the memory yet.
- The bmiHeader.biHeight will be negative because that will affect the way it is drawn on the screen, in this case it will be drawn from top left to right top to botom.
- We will cast the BitmapMemory to a uint8 for pointer arithmetic porpuses.

### Notes
- We can change the Memory Protection Constants of our page to PAGE_NOACCESS, to deal with pointers hanging to our page, which are hard to spot.
- we define convinient uint8 type for unsigned char(we will import stdint to get lots of convinient values)
